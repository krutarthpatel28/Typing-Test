# Typing Speed Test - Tkinter Python Application

## Overview

This project is a **Typing Speed Test** application built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library. It allows users to test their typing speed by typing a randomly selected paragraph within a time limit of 30 seconds. After the time runs out, the app calculates and displays the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM). This is an ideal project for beginners learning GUI programming with Python and Tkinter.

## Features

- Randomly selects a paragraph for each test from a predefined list.
- A 30-second countdown timer that starts when the user begins typing.
- Real-time feedback on correct and incorrect words.
- Displays words per minute (WPM) after the timer ends.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.
